# Testing Strategy for TodoMVC Cypress Project

This document outlines the testing strategy for the TodoMVC Cypress testing project, detailing the objectives, scope, and types of tests implemented.

## Objectives

- **Ensure Functional Correctness**: Verify that the application behaves as expected in various scenarios, including edge cases.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **UI/UX Consistency**: Ensure that the user interface remains consistent and accessible across different browsers and devices.
- **Performance and Scalability**: Verify that the application handles a large number of todos efficiently and maintains performance.

## Types of Tests

### 1. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
End-to-End tests simulate real user interactions with the application. These tests cover the entire flow from adding a todo item to marking it as complete, editing it, and deleting it.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Adding, editing, completing, and deleting todos.
- Bulk actions such as marking all todos as complete or clearing completed todos.
- Persistence checks across page reloads.

### 2. **UI/UX Tests**
These tests focus on the user interface and user experience aspects, ensuring that the application is user-friendly and accessible.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Verifying the focus state of input fields.
- Testing keyboard navigation and accessibility features.
- Checking responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### 3. **Negative Tests**
Negative testing ensures that the application can gracefully handle invalid or unexpected inputs.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Adding empty todos.
- Handling special characters or excessively long todo titles.

### 4. **Performance Tests**
Performance testing is crucial to ensure that the application remains responsive and functional under load.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Adding a large number of todos and verifying performance.
- Testing the application's response to bulk actions with a high number of items.

## Test Coverage

### Functional Coverage
- **Todos Management**: Add, edit, complete, delete, and persist todos.
- **Bulk Actions**: Toggle all, clear completed, and delete all todos.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle empty inputs, long titles, and special characters.

### UI/UX Coverage
- **Accessibility**: Focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Responsiveness**: Display and functionality across various screen sizes and devices.

### Non-Functional Coverage
- **Performance**: Ensure the application remains performant with a large number of todos.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle unexpected inputs or actions.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Cypress**: The main testing framework used for writing and running all tests.

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures comprehensive coverage of critical functionalities, UI/UX aspects, and non-functional requirements, providing confidence in the stability and reliability of the TodoMVC application.
